# ResNet-based CNN in PyTorch

## Overview
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch, based on a ResNet architecture. The model was adapted from a research paper on [topic or goal].

## Dataset
[Briefly describe the dataset used, e.g., CIFAR-10 or a custom dataset.]

## Implementation
- Framework: PyTorch
- Model: ResNet-based CNN
- Features: [Briefly describe key features, e.g., data augmentation, dropout.]

## Results
[Include key metrics or a summary of results.]


## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
